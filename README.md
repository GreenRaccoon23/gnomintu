Fusion of Mint-X, GNOME, Ubuntu-Mono, and Humanity icon themes. Close to Mint-X but incorporates the best GNOME, Ubuntu-Mono, and Humanity icons. Arch Linux logos included.

Gnomintu theme: Mint-X folders (stock).

Gnomintu-Green theme: Green Ubuntu-Mono folders (#40BF4A http://coloreminder.com/40bf4a).

Gnomintu-Archblue theme: Blue Ubuntu-Mono folders (official Arch Linux blue: http://coloreminder.com/1793D1)

If using Arch Linux, this theme is in the AUR. Install it by running:
yaourt -Sa gnomintu-icon-theme-git

For other distributions, do this:
1) Clone this repo by running:
git clone https://github.com/GreenRaccoon23/gnomintu-icon-theme

2)Run the INSTALL script.
If you'd rather install the themes manually, copy the 'Gnomintu', 'Gnomintu-Green', and 'Gnomintu-Archblue' folders (NOT the 'gnomintu-icon-theme' folder) to either '/usr/share/icons' or '~/.icons'. You might want to run 'gtk-update-icon-cache' too.

This theme is made from sources that are open source for non-commercial use. Feel free to modify and distribute this package as long as you respect the sources' conditions. :)
