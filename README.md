Fusion of Mint-X, GNOME, Ubuntu-Mono, and Humanity icon themes. Close to Mint-X but incorporates the best GNOME, Ubuntu-Mono, and Humanity icons. Arch Linux logos included.

To install, run the INSTALL script.
If you'd rather install them manually, copy the 'Gnomintu', 'Gnomintu-Green', and 'Gnomintu-Archblue' folders (NOT the 'gnomintu-icon-theme' folder) to either '/usr/share/icons' or '~/.icons'. You might want to run 'gtk-update-icon-cache' too.

This theme is made from sources that are open source for non-commercial use. Feel free to modify and distribute this package as long as you respect the sources' conditions. :)
